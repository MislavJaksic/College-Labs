## APR

APR stands for "Analiza i projektiranje računalom" (eng. Computer analysis and design).

### Syllabus

Translated from Croatian to English:

1) solving linear systems: these algorithms are used while solving more complex problems.
2) nonlinear optimization processes: takes up most of the semester. There are problems which cannot be solved exactly.
3) genetic and evolutionary algorithms: similar to 2), but they are stochastic algorithms.
4) state transitions analysis: understand how solids and liquids can be simulated in an "engine". How to quickly calculate what will physically happen.
5) error analysis: problems occur if the mistake has compounded. Kahn's algorithm.
6) algorithm complexity: a well known subject.

### Labs

Tasks which I had to solve and algorithms I had to implement to pass the course.

### Lectures

A collection of notes I made during the lecture. The notes are written in Croatian.

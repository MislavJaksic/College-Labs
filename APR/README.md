## APR

APR stands for "Analiza i projektiranje računalom" (eng. Computer Aided Analysis and Design).


### [Syllabus](http://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/apr)

The following algorithms were taught during the course, but were not mplemented: Fibbonaci section search, Gauss-Newton, Levenberg-Marquardt, calculating the stability of numerical integration methods.


### Laboratory exercices

Lab_1: Matrix class, LU and LUP decomposition, back and foward substitution

Lab_2: golden section search, Nealder-Mead simplex method, Hooke-Jeeves method on Rosenbrock's function

Lab_3: gradient descent, Newton-Raphson method, Box method, constrained problem transformation on Rosenbrock's function

Lab_4: genetic algorithm capable of finding a global minimum of Schaffer's F6 and F7

Lab_5: fourth order Runge-Kutta numerical integration method


### Lecture notes

A collection of notes I made during the lectures. The notes are written in Croatian.

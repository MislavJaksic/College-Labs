## APR

APR stands for "Analiza i projektiranje računalom" (eng. Computer Aided Analysis and Design).

### Syllabus

The following algorithms and concepts were taught during the course, but were not implemented:
* Fibonacci section search, Gauss-Newton, Levenberg-Marquardt, determining the stability of numerical integration methods, calculating floating point precision

### Laboratory exercises

* Lab_1: matrix class similar to numpy, LU and LUP decomposition, back and forward substitution

* Lab_2: golden section search, Nealder-Mead simplex method, Hooke-Jeeves method on [Rosenbrock's function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenbrock_function)

* Lab_3: gradient descent, Newton-Raphson method, Box method, constrained problem transformation on Rosenbrock's function

* Lab_4: genetic algorithm capable of finding a global minimum of Schaffer's [F6](https://www.cs.unm.edu/~neal.holts/dga/benchmarkFunction/schafferf6.html) and [F7](https://www.cs.unm.edu/~neal.holts/dga/benchmarkFunction/schafferf7.html)

* Lab_5: fourth order Runge-Kutta numerical integration method

### Lectures

I took down notes using a laptop. The notes are in Croatian.

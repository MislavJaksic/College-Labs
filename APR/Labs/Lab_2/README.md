## Lab Two:

Implement unimodal interval search.
Implement golden section search. Srart it with either a starting point or interval.
  - if started with a starting point, do the unimodal interval search

In each step, print out the values of all four points and their goal function values.
Epsilon should be 10**(-6).
k constant should be calculated as 0.5*(sqrt(5)-1). (Value is very close to 0.618034)
  - WARNING! The golden ratio is 1.6180...

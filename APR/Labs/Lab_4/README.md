## Lab Four

Implemented a genetic algorithm that does the following:  
*  create population
*  evaluate the population
*  repeat:
    *    choose 3 creatures at random 
    *    kill the worst among them
    *    new_creature = crossover(two surviving creatures)
    *    mutate new_creature with some probability
    *    evaluate the new_creature
    *    add the new_creature to population
*  until(stop condition has been reached)

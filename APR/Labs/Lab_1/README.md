## Lab One

Implement a Matrix class which will allows you to effortlessly manipulate matrices.  

Functionalities:  
*  constructor. ->  \_\_init\_\_
*  deconstructor. -> del
*  access an element's value. -> \_\_getitem\_\_ with \[\] notation
*  set an element's value. -> \_\_setitem\_\_ with \[\] notation
*  pretty print a matrix and its dimensions. -> \_\_str\_\_
*  add, subtract, multiply and transpose. -> \_\_add\_\_, \_\_sub\_\_, \_\_mul\_\_, #transpose
*  increment and decrement. -> \_\_iadd\_\_, \_\_isub\_\_
*  multiply with a scalar value. -> scale
*  check equality. -> \_\_eg\_\_
*  read matrix from a file. -> fromFile
*  output matrix to a file. -> toFile

The Matrix class should also implement forward and back substitution as well as LU and LUP decomposition.  
As a bonus, implement a method that inverses the matrix.

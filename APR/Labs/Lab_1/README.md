## Lab One:

Implement a Matrix class which will allows you to effortlessly manipulate matrices.
Functionalities:
  constructor. -> __init__
  deconstructor. -> del
  access an element's value. -> __getitem__ with [] notation
  set an element's value. -> __setitem__ with [] notation
  pretty print a matrix and its dimensions. -> __str__
  add, subtract, multiply and transpose. -> __add__, __sub__, __mul__, #transpose
  increment and decrement. -> __iadd__, __isub__
  multiply with a scalar value. -> scale
  check equality. -> __eg__
  read matrix from a file. -> fromFile
  output matrix to a file. -> toFile

The Matrix class should also implement forward and back substitution as well as LU and LUP decomposition.
As a bonus, implement a method that inverses the matrix.

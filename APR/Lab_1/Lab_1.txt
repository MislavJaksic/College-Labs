First lab:
  implement a Matrix class which will allows you to more easily manipulate with matrices.
  functionalities:
    constructor. -> __init__
    deconstructor. -> del
    access an element's value. -> __getitem__ with [] notation
    set an element's value. -> __setitem__ with [] notation
    pretty print a matrix and its dimensions. -> __str__
    add, subtract, multiply and transpose. -> __add__, __sub__, __mul__, #transpose
    increment and decrement. -> __iadd__, __isub__
    multiply with a scalar value. -> scale
    check equality. -> __eg__
    read matrix from a file. -> fromFile
    output matrix to a file. -> toFile

The Matrix class should implement forward and back substitution as well as both LU and LUP decomposition.

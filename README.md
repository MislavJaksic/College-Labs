## College Labs

During my graduate study at the University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing,
I've had the pleasure of documenting, testing and implementing a plethora of algorithms. Solutions are grouped
by course and each one has its own folder. Additional information about the course or exercise can be found in
their respective folders.

Note: the reason why the repository is called "College Labs" is because programming exercises were conducted in
computer labs.

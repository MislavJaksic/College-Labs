## College Labs

During my graduate study at the University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing,
I've had the pleasure of documenting, testing and implementing a plethora of algorithms. Solutions are grouped
by course and each one has its own folder. Additional information about the course or exercise can be found in
their respective folders.

### [APR](http://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/apr) (eng. Computer Aided Analysis and Design)

* Solving systems of linear equations - matrix manipulation, forward and back substitution, LU and LUP decomposition
* Single variable nonlinear function optimization - golden section search, Nealder-Mead simplex method, Hooke-Jeeves method
* Multiple variable nonlinear function optimization - gradient descent, Newton-Raphson method
* Constrained optimization - Box method, constrained problem transformation
* Genetic algorithms - representation, crossover, mutation, optimal parameter search
* Numerical integration - Runge-Kutta methods

### [FMOS](http://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/fmisd) (eng. Formal Methods in System Design)

### [NOS](http://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/aos) (eng. Advanced Operating Systems)

* Communication between processes - message queues, pipelines
* Mutual exclusion in distributed systems - Lamport's distributed protocol, Ricart-Agrawala protocol
* Cryptography - security demands, DES, AES, block ciphers, RSA, Miller-Rabin primality test, digital envelope, signature and seal, hash functions
* Security protocols - Diffie-Hellman protocol, Needham–Schroeder protocol, Kerberos protocols, PKI
* RAID

Key: DES is Data Encryption Standard, AES is Advanced Encryption Standard, RSA is Rivest–Shamir–Adleman, PKI is Public Key Infrastructure, RAID is Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks

### [PP](http://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/parpro) (eng. Parallel Programming)

* Introduction to High Performance Computing (HPC) - parallel programming models, properties and sequential to parallel conversion
* Message Passing Interface (MPI) - process communication, MPI functions, blocking and non-blocking
* Parallel Random Access Machine (PRAM) - synchronous and asynchronous, *_reduce algorithm
* Designing parallel programs - phases, hypercube algorithm, N-tree algorithm
* Quantitative analysis of parallel algorithms - time to execute, efficiency and isoefficiency, speedup, scalability

### [SU](http://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/su) (eng. Machine Learning)

* Linear regression, cross validation, feature, model and hyperparameter analysis
* Logistic regression, one-vs-one, one-vs-rest classification
* Support vector machines, kernel functions, K nearest neighbours
* Ensambles, maximum likelihood and aposteriori estimators
* Probabilistic graphical models, clustering



Note: the reason why the repository is called "College Labs" is because programming exercises were conducted in
computer labs.

## College Labs

During the master's studies at the University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, I've had the pleasure of documenting, testing and implementing a plethora of algorithms to solve a multitude of problems. Problems and solutions are divided by subject. Additional information about the subject and the exercises can be found in their respective folder.


APR (eng. Computer Aided Analysis and Design):
Solving systems of linear equations - matrix manipulation, foward and back substitution, LU and LUP decomposition

SU (eng. Machine Learning):


Note: The lectures in which students had to demonstrate that they have successfully solve a problem are called laboratories which is where the name of this repository comes from.

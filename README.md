## College Labs

During the master's studies at the University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, I've had the pleasure of documenting, testing and implementing a plethora of algorithms to solve a multitude of problems. Each solution has its own folder and are grouped by course. Additional information about the courses and exercises can be found in their respective folders.


### APR (eng. Computer Aided Analysis and Design)

* Solving systems of linear equations - matrix manipulation, forward and back substitution, LU and LUP decomposition
* Single variable nonlinear function optimization - golden section search, Nealder-Mead simplex method, Hooke-Jeeves method
* Multiple variable nonlinear function optimization - gradient descent, Newton-Raphson method
* Constrained optimization - Box method, constrained problem transformation
* Genetic algorithm - representation, crossover, mutation, optimal parameter search
* Numerical integration - Runge-Kutta methods

### SU (eng. Machine Learning)

* Linear regression, cross validation, feature, model and hyperparameter analysis
* Logistic regression, one-vs-one, one-vs-rest classification
* Support vector machines, kernel functions, K nearest neighbours
* Ensambles, maximum likelihood and aposteriori estimators
* Probabilistic graphical models, clustering

Note: The classes during which students had to demonstrate that they have successfully solve a problem are called laboratories. That is why this repository is called Collage-Labs.

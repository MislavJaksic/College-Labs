## Lab One

Sensors record measurements.  
A sensor will correct its measurement by asking the closest sensor for its measurement.  
Sensors send their measurements central server.  
The server has a REST interface.  
Every sensor has to register itself at the central server.  
Sensors ask the central server for the address of the closest sensor.  

There are N sensors and only one cental server.

## SU

SU stands for "Strojno ucenje" (eng. Machine learning).

### [Syllabus](http://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/su)

The following algorithms and concepts were taught during the course, but were not implemented:
* Inductive bias, perceptron, naive Bayes.

### Laboratory exercises (Labs)

Tasks such as cross validation, feature, model and hyperparameter analysis were performed in multiple labs, so instead of writing them below in almost every lab, I've extracted these topic here.

* Lab_0: jupyter notebooks, python and sklearn library introductory exercises

* Lab_1: normal, regularized, L1 and L2 linear regression, collinearity problem

* Lab_2: regression as a classifier, one-vs-one and one-vs-rest classification, normal and regularized logistic regression

* Lab_3: support vector machine (SVM), kernel functions, hyperparameter analysis, K nearest neighbours, dimensionality "curse"

* Lab_4: ensambles, bagging, boosting, maximum liklihood estimator (MLE), maximum aposteriori estimator (MAP)

* Lab_5: probabilistic graphical models, clustering with K nearest neighbours

Note: because the classes were taught in Croatian, all lab assignments are also written in Croatian.

### Lectures

A collection of notes I made during the lecture. The notes are written in Croatian.

## SU

SU stands for "Strojno učenje" (eng. Machine learning).

### Laboratory exercises (Labs)

Tasks such as cross validation, feature, model and hyperparameter analysis were performed in multiple labs, so
instead of writing them below in almost every lab, I've extracted those topic.

* Lab_0: jupyter notebooks, python and sklearn library introductory exercises

* Lab_1: normal, regularized, L1 and L2 linear regression, collinearity problem

* Lab_2: regression as a classifier, one-vs-one and one-vs-rest classification, normal and regularized logistic regression

* Lab_3: support vector machine (SVM), kernel functions, hyperparameter analysis, K nearest neighbours, dimensionality "curse"

* Lab_4: ensambles, bagging, boosting, maximum liklihood estimator (MLE), maximum aposteriori estimator (MAP)

* Lab_5: probabilistic graphical models, clustering with K nearest neighbours

### Unimplemented algorithms

The following algorithms and concepts were taught during the course, but were not implemented:
* Inductive bias, perceptron, naive Bayes

## Lab Two

A player plays "Connect Four" against a computer. The grid is of infinite height and at least seven in width.
The computer decides their move by brute force searching a tree. The tree's depth can be anywhere from two to
around eight. Whichever move leads to least defeats and most victories at the maximum search depth is the move
which the computer will make.

The computer can use up to eight processors to complete its calculation. The speedup and efficiency have been
plotted against the number of processors employed to complete the task and can be seen in the Documentation
folder.

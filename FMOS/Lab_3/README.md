## Lab Three

We were given a number of Promela programs ready to be analyzed by the model cheking tool Spin. We had to analyze the program and use the tool to determine if certain properties, such as liveness, hold. If they don't, we had to explain why.

Exacution paths can be visualised using a BÃ¼chi automaton.

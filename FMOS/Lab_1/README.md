## Lab One

Use NuSVM to check if a program satisfies the following properties: safety, liveness, no blocking and no
sequencing. I've used Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas to check them. If a formula is not satisfied, the
NuSVM tool will print out an example of the execution path that will lead to the conflicting state.

This Lab is more concerned about exploring a new verification language then constructing an optimal solution or
creating a working algorithm.

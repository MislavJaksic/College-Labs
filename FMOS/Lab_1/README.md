## Lab One

Use NuSVM to check if a program satisfies the following properties:  
safety,  
liveness,  
no blocking,  
no sequencing.  

I've used Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas to check them.  
If a formula is not satisfied, the NuSVM tool will print out an example of the execution path that will lead
to the conflicting state.  

This Lab was more concerned about exploring a new verification language then constructing an optimal solution.

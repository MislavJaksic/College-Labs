### Chapter 3

Scalability: ability of a system to accommodate growth.

Representational State Transfer: REST, set of design criteria for building scalable distributed hypermedia systems
                                 RESTful, a property of a system that satisfies the principles of REST

REST constraints:
  - Network: client-server architecture
               - for seperation of concerns, servers host and server, while clients format and display
             layered system
               - enable network intermediaries to be deployed between the client and server (proxies and gateways)
                 - proxy: connects applications that speak the same protocol (browser, web server with HTTP)
                          clients see a proxy as a server and servers see a proxy as a client
                          may modify the requests and responses
                          use cases: filtering content, caching, load balancing (proxies are then called surrogates, reverse proxy or server accelerator)
                 - gateway: connects applications that speak different protocols (browser email server with HTTP and POP)
               - some intermediaries can intercept communication which enables them to enhance security, cache results, load balance requests and convert between protocols
  
  - Content: addressability
               - Resource Oriented Architecture (ROA), expose an application as a set of resources
                 - concepts and semantics
                   - resource is an atom of data (a document, an image or similar)
                   - resources are access with HTTP as they reside on a server
                   - each resource has at least one unique resource identifier
                   - resource representation are data formats send to clients as a response
                 - implementation
                   - resource identifiers are Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
                     - almost every URI is a URL
                     - URLs are paths to a resource
                     - <scheme>://<user>:<pass>@<host>:<port>/<path>;<params>?<query>#<fragment>
                       - <scheme> specify a protocol to use when accessing a resource on a server (HTTP, HTTPS, ...)
                       - <user>:<pass> some private servers require them
                       - <host>:<port> locate the server on which the resource is hosted
                       - <path> specify the path on a server to a resource
                       - <params> specify input params (rarely used by HTTP)
                       - <query> specify name-value pairs
                       - <fragment> some HTTP documents can be divided into smaller parts
               - if done correctly, a program will easily be able to access resources
             
             connectedness  
               - resource can have more then one representation; all representations represent the same resource state
               - resource representations should contain hypermedia links to other resources
                 - HTML pages often contain links to other pages (human readable)
                 - XML and JSON are data formats (representations) that are both human and machine readable and can also contain links
               - HTTP media types are used to distinguish resource representations
                 - specified in HTTP metadata headers: Content-Type and Content-Length
                 - Media type syntax (MIME types)
                   - type / subtype ; [parameter]
                     - type 
                     - subtype 
                     - [parameter]

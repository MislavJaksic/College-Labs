## Lab One

Implemented a Connector class and its context Manager, so I don't have to think about managing a connection to PostgreSQL.  

One class constructs and another executes SQL queries.  
Possible queries are:  
* search for phrases  
* rank phrases  
* autocomplete a phrase  
* pivot a table  

There are also a number of useful SQL scripts which allow me to quickly reconstruct the database if need be.

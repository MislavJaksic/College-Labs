## NMBP NoSQL Lab 2

The Lab was solved using Python.  

Run the solution by running Python Flask. For details on how to do that, see [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MislavJaksic/Flask-Tutorial).

Twenty thousand articles were imported using "inserter.py" in the "databasing" package and "data_functions.py" in the "data_generation" package.
